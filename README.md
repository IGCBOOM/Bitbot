# Bitbot
Discord bot for bitbucket commits.

Just fill in botToken, guildID, and channelID to get the bot working and make sure to host it somewhere.
Make sure to point the bitbucket webhook to your bot url at port 9107 (the port the bot runs on. You can change this if you want.)
Currently only does commits but if people are interested I can add other events.
